+ Loot Integrations Addons (Better Archeology, Dungeons and Taverns)
+ Modpack Update Checker (pack update verification checks)
+ Wandering Bags
+ Wandering Wares

Removed:
- Wan's Ancient Beasts

Developer Notes:
Added better advancements, no longer dealing with that painfully small window!
Added easier configurability in-game! It will make updating configs much easier while the game is loaded.
Added more quests for Goblins' Tyranny and two new quest chapters for Hexalia and Eidolon: Repraised magic mods.
Added modpack version checking utilities to indicate better if your client and server configurations are compatible.
Completely redone the main menu buttons and layout! If the new layout does not apply, please reinstall the modpack.
Removed Wan's Ancient Beasts since Ice & Fire already satisfies the modpack's mob needs.
Tweaked Advancement Plaques' configuration should reduce the frequency of announcement spam on player advancements.
